# Deep Learning with Actuarial Applications in R
Material for the 2-day block course "Deep Learning with Actuarial Applications in R" of the [Swiss Association of Actuaries](www.actuaries.ch).
- Programme: https://www.actuaries.ch/de/downloads/aid!90833b8c-0384-4bc9-ae7b-7824db589a7a/id!132/SAV_Blockkurs_Ausschreibung_def_05032020.pdf.
- Registration: https://www.actuaries.ch/de/kurs/block_course_deep_learning_with_actuarial_applications_in_r/ereig!3752/


### Prerequisites:
- Good knowledge of insurance risk modelling
- Experience in basic R programming, i.e. familiar with tidyverse, ggplot2 and base package (Hint: you should already know how to fit a glm in R)
- Participants need to bring their own laptop. It is an advantage to have R/RStudio installed lo-cally, but not required to do the exercises.

### Topics:
- Topic 1: Recap: Generalized Linear Models
- Topic 2: Feedforward Neural Networks
- Topic 3: Combined Actuarial and Neural Network Models
- Topic 4: Recurrent Neural Networks
- Topic 5: Convolutional Neural Networks
- Topic 6: Unsupervised Learning
- Topic 7: Non-discriminatory Insurance Pricing
