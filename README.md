### Prerequisites:
- Good knowledge of insurance risk modelling
- Experience in basic R programming, i.e. familiar with tidyverse, ggplot2 and base package (Hint: you should already know how to fit a glm in R)

Topics:
- Topic 1: Recap: Generalized Linear Models
- Topic 2: Feedforward Neural Networks
- Topic 3: Combined Actuarial and Neural Network Models
- Topic 4: Recurrent Neural Networks
- Topic 5: Unsupervised Learning
- Topic 6: Non-discriminatory Insurance Pricing
